Hello there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"> 
This project is a datacamp practice project that I have done while studying the data scientist with R track :)

## üëÄ Scenario
<img src="https://planning-org-uploaded-media.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnail/scenario-planning-2.png" width="120px">

Throughout the world of data science, there are many languages and tools that can be used to complete a given task. While you are often able to use whichever tool you prefer, it is often important for analysts to work with similar platforms so that they can share their code with one another.

In this project, we are going to find out what tools and languages professionals use in their day-to-day work. Our data comes from the Kaggle Data Science Survey which includes responses from over 10,000 people that write code to analyze data in their daily work.


## üéØ Objectives  

**1.Find out the different tools and languages that the survey respondents use at work.**

**2.Analyze how many respondents use R , Python or both , basically analyzing the language preference among  professionals.**

**3.Analyze which language do the users of R / Python recommend to new learners.**

 ## ‚öôÔ∏è Process:
  1. **Setting up our working environment**: Github repository & Jupyter Notebook 
  2. **Data  Understanding**:
 - Understanding the dataset we have :

| Variable              | Description                                                                                   |
|:----------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Respondent              |  The number of the respondent  |
| WorkToolsSelect                  |  The different set of tools each respondent works with.                 |
| LanguageRecommendationSelect                   |  Which language does the respondent recommend ?                                       |
| EmployerIndustry	     |  The industry in which the employer of the responder operates ?  |
| WorkAlgorithmsSelect	     | Which algorithms does the respondent use in his data science projects.  |
</div>

  3. **Data Exploration**: 
  - Analyzing the number of respondents per each data science tool. 
  - Creating visualizations to explore the language preference , and language recommendation.

  **From the plot above, We can see that the most used language in data science is python with around 6000 kaggle data scientists followed by R with around 4700 users.**
  
  **We wanted to take a closer look at the users of each respondent tool , we want to see which respondents only use Python , those who only use R and those who use both of them.**
 From the plot below , we can see that the number of users of both tools is around 3700 , which is higher than the number of users of each tool solely.

**We also wanted to analyze the language recommendation of the respondents , that is which language do the professionals that use R, python or both of them recommend to new learners , do R lovers always recommend R ?.**

 From the plot above , we can see that the users of both tools (R and Python) and the users of python always recommend python to new learners while the users of R recommend R.
